          A black hole is a place in space where gravity pulls so much that even
          light can not get out. The gravity is so strong because matter has
          been squeezed into a tiny space. This can happen when a star is dying.

        Black holes can be big or small. Scientists think the smallest black
        holes are as small as just one atom. These black holes are very tiny but
        have the mass of a large mountain. Mass is the amount of matter, or
        "stuff," in an object. Another kind of black hole is called "stellar."
        Its mass can be up to 20 times more than the mass of the sun. There may
        be many, many stellar mass black holes in Earth's galaxy. Earth's galaxy
        is called the Milky Way. The largest black holes are called
        "supermassive." These black holes have masses that are more than 1
        million suns together. Scientists have found proof that every large
        galaxy contains a supermassive black hole at its center. The
        supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy is called
        Sagittarius A. It has a mass equal to about 4 million suns and would fit
        inside a very large ball that could hold a few million Earths.
